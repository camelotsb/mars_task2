# Q2
The different node to node communication meathods in ros can be
- Communication with topics.
- Communication with services.
- Communication with Actions.
---
## With topics:
Communication via topics is when a node publishes a message under topics to which other nodes are subscribed.
Here, a published message can be recieved by many other nodes and similary messages published by many nodes can be recieved by a single node.

This creates the patterns of publishing namely:
  - one to one
  - one to many
  - many to one
  - many to many.

<p>This can be used in cases where continuous data is being sent, example:1)sensory data
as, there might be a need for multiple nodes to be able to recieve this data. 2)command data , such as publishing the velocity here different nodes might have the need to recieve this command.</p>

## With service:
Communication via service is done by pair of messages (only one to one), which is a request/reply architecture. Where a ros node offers a service under a string name, and a client node calls the service by sending the request message awaiting a reply.

Service is handy when there has to be two way communication between two nodes. example: 1)When you send a data to get back a response. 2)When the node controlling an actuator has to get data from a node that does computation(quick actions).
