## Navigation
The sensors used in navigation include.
- inertial sensors comprising accelerometer and gyroscopes.
- Visual sensors suchas LIDA , RGBD cam, conventional color camera, etc.

There can aslo be linear or rotary actuators on which the cisual sensors can be mounted for better localisation and mapping, by moving the range of vision.

## Mobility and power
The sensors used for mobilty and power include.
- distance sensors and sensors for speed measurement like, Wheel pulse encoder, microwave sensor

Actuators are installed (both linear and rotary) to control the motion and state of the rover.
That is, rotary to spin the wheel and other actuators to control wheel alignment etc.

---
## Robotic arm
The sensors used for the robotic arm include.
- Visual sensor through which affects the motion plan of the robotic arm.
- Force torque sensors to detect the amount of force being provided.
- Additionally thermal sensors can be addded.

The linear actuators help in the motion of the arm itslelf, whereas a rotary actuator can be used to control the motion of the gripper attached to the arm.
